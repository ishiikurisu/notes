  - According to OSM, it's apparently faster to go from here directly to
     Beijing, China through the Gobi Desert than going through India
    - This is because there is no direct connection between Hyderabad and
       India; and there is no direct connection between India and China
  - I was initially planning on going through India because it has enough
     infrastructure to allow for a road trip; just for the record
