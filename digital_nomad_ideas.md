# Digital Nomad Decision Process

Given the opportunity, it would be nice to live in a different place every
now and then.

What is the desired scenario to make this happen?

- Be able to work from home
- Earn enough to pay the bills
- Have a reliable safety net

Given these are part of your reality, how do you plan a nomad lifestyle?
In my case, I narrowed it down to spending 3 months every year in a different city.
This implies I have to be able to work there and to live there comfortably.

To decide whether I can live in a city, I have to compare how much I earn
with the cost of living there. To find out how much I need to live somewhere,
I will use the following tools:

- [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) has some really good crowdsourced livability figures
- I will assume I can live in an [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com.br/) for a couple of months
- My dreams to pick the places I want to travel and live for a while
- [SkyScanner](https://www.skyscanner.com.br/) can be used for travel tickets.

This strategy assumes the following:

- I will not need a car for transportation while there
- Visa situation is solvable
- I will pay for my stay and my stay only

In a practical side, some tips to make better decisions based on my experience
on Floripa:

- Always check the prices for families (or at least couples), this will provide
  safer price estimates
- Walkability is probably the most important factor when choosing a neighborhood
  given my lifestyle

euros there!
